I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself "confused" by a lot of JavaScript game engines.

So I made Lorina.

Lorina is a bare-bones-only-ish game engine with simple-ish, English-sentence-structure-based syntax.  For example, if you want to draw a rectangle, tell Lorina:
    
    l.draw.rectangle(30, 50, 100, 65, '#ff0000', 0.6)
    
This would translate to:

    Lorina, draw a rectangle at 30px and 50px and make it 100px wide and 65px tall.  Oh, and fill it with red and make it a bit transparent.

None of this is particularly groundbreaking or overwhelmingly awesome, but I'm certainly having fun.

Lorina is named after Lorina Charlotte Liddell, sister of Alice Pleasance Liddell whom "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was written for/about.
