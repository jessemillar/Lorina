I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself "confused" by a lot of JavaScript game engines.

So I made Lorina.

Lorina is simple.  Super simple.  It's got command chaining similar to jQuery and doesn't hide anything from the end programmer.  Seriously.  Hack away if you so desire.

I know none of this is particularly groundbreaking or overwhelmingly awesome, but I'm certainly having fun.

Oh, Lorina is named after Lorina Charlotte Liddell, sister of Alice Pleasance Liddell whom "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was written for/about.

I've got a thing for "Alice's Adventures."
