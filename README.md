I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself "confused" by a lot of JavaScript game engines.

So I made Lorina.

None of this is particularly groundbreaking or overwhelmingly awesome, but I'm certainly having fun.

Lorina is named after Lorina Charlotte Liddell, sister of Alice Pleasance Liddell whom "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was written for/about.
