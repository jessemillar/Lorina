I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself "confused" by the JavaScript game engines currently available.

Thus Lorina was born.

Lorina is a bare-bones-only-ish game engine with simple-ish, English-sentence-structure-based syntax.  If you want to draw a rectangle, tell Lorina:

Lorina, draw a rectangle at x and y and make it this wide and this tall.  Oh, and draw it this color and make it this transparent.
l.draw.rectangle(x, y, width, height, color, opacity)

Changes will come fast and break things because that's how I roll.
