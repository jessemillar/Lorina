I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself confused by the JavaScript game engines currently available.

Thus Lorina was born.

Lorina is a bare-bones-only-ish game engine with simple-ish syntax.  Heck, it makes sense to me and that's all that really matters since nobody else is ever gonna find this page.

As development continues and nears "completion" (Hint: A LONG way off), I'll add some proper documentation and pump out some demos.

Use at your own risk.  Ye be warned.
