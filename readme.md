I needed a way to quickly make HTML5 game prototypes but found myself confused by the game engines currently available.

Thus Lorina was born.

Lorina is a bare-bones-only game engine with syntax (hopefully) simple enough that a child could use it.

As development continues and nears "completion," I'll add some proper documentation and pump out some demos.
